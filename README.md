# DRAFT Indigenous Language license agreement

*‘For we speak as others have spoken before us. And a sense of language is also a feeling for ways of living that have meant something.’* – Rush Rhees

This repository exists to collect feedback on Tiro Typeworks' draft Indigenous Language font user license agreement. This is a new kind of license agreement that will be used for some of our fonts to make them available at no cost and no restrictions on numbers of installations, web views, etc. *so long as they are used for indigenous language content.* The goal of this license is to encourage language preservation and education, and to support quality typography in indigenous language publishing. At present, the license is limited to indigenous languages of the Americas. Additional explanation is included in the draft preamble to the license agreement.

The repository consists of the current draft version of the license agreement in PDF format, and, as they are superceded by new versions, an archive of older drafts. Feedback comments and suggestions should be logged as 'Issues'. To create a new Issue or to follow and respond to existing feedback, please open the Issue tab above. If you do not have a GitHub account and prefer not to obtain one, you can also email feedback to [*license@tiro.ca*](mailto:license@tiro.ca)

We appreciate any feedback you are able to give, to help us ensure appropriate wording and make this license type widely useful for the intended goal. We'll need to have the final draft text reviewed by a lawyer, but before that happens we want to give the intended users a chance to provide feedback.

In anticipation of some possible questions:

### *What do we mean by ‘indigenous language‘?*
We have a clear idea of what we mean by the term, but need also to make sure it is clear in the wording of the license agreement. We have done this by listing examples of the terms used in Canada and the United States to refer to indigenous peoples, with the recognition that not all of these terms either have specific legal meaning or are accepted by the peoples to whom they are applied. Suggestions for other ways to handle this, or suggestions of additional respectful terms—and corresponding terms used in Central and South America—, are particularly welcome.

### *What kind of fonts will be available under this license?*
Our intention is to make indigenous language fonts available as distinct packages, separate from our commercial license fonts. The fonts may either be functionally identical to commercial versions, or may be a subset or extension of a commercial package, or may exist only as an indigenous language font (e.g. in the case of a font for a uniquely indigenous writing system such as Cherokee syllabics). Some of the indigenous language fonts will support a broad range of languages aiming, ultimately, for complete support for all the indigenous languages and orthographies of the Americas; others will target specific languages or language groups.

### *Why not a libre or open source license?*
Some Tiro Typeworks fonts and other kinds of projects are available under the Open Font License or other libre or open source license types. For the Indigenous Language license, we wanted an agreement that would give users many of the benefits of an open license in terms of no financial cost and limited restrictions on use, but to also retain our ability to sell commercial licenses to the same or related typefaces and fonts when not used for indigenous languages. We decided the best way to do this would be to create a special license type associated with language use.

### *Why only indigenous languages of the Americas?*
Indigenous language loss is a global issue. In virtually every country, minority linguistic communities of various kinds struggle to retain their distinctive languages, and hence their distinctive ways of living and world views. Indigenous language communities often do so alongside struggles of other kinds: for autonomy, for access to their lands and their resources, for life. As a Canadian type foundry, we're limiting our scope to the indigenous languages of the Americas simply because its an area we know something about. We hope our Indigenous Language license agreement might inspire others.
